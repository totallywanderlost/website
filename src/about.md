# About

After covid ruined our 2020 travel plans, we put things on hold, got new jobs and even attempted to buy a house by the seaside. But 2 years later than planned, we are ready to hit the road!

Follow us on our adventures, starting in Australia. We'll be updating our location on the [map](journey), uploading as many [photos](photos) as we can, and writing up our best bits in the [blog](blog).
