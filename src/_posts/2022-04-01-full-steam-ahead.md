summary: Here we go! Notices have been handed in, plans are being made, and belongings are being sold. But what are our plans? To be honest, we're not entirely sure, but we'll tell you what we do know! And it's full steam ahead getting ready to head to our first stop - Australia.

## How did we get here?

**So, where to start?** Friends and Family will know that we've been talking about travelling for a long time, we even booked a trip and told everyone we were leaving back in 2020 and then a little worldwide pandemic postponed all our plans. Since then we've both got new jobs, tried to buy a house by the seaside, and spent a lot of time thinking about our pre-covid plans.

Now in 2022 the world is looking a little bit more normal, and we're going to give it another shot. But the plans have changed a bit, partly because of covid, partly because we now have a little bit more cash in the bank to spend!

## So What's the Plan?

At the moment, we have very little planned. We're going to get working holiday visas for Australia whilst we still can (James is almost too old!), and hopefully travel around as much of the country as we can over 6-12 months. Then we'll see how much money we have left and where we want to go - we could go and work in New Zealand, or live the nomadic life backpacking our way home through Asia.

I'm sure in the next few months before we go we'll firm up some plans, but the idea is to keep things fairly fluid. By staying in one country for a long time we'll hopefully minimise any risk of covid causing travel issues again, and the bonus with Australia is if we want to stay put for a while or need some extra cash coming in we can always get a short term job whilst we're on a working holiday visa.

## What's next?

This past month has been a bit hectic. James has quit his job and has a few weeks left, we've served notice on our flat, and found a lovely new home for the one member of the family without a passport (Draco the Cat!). We've started clearing out some of our stuff and sorting the rest for selling, donating or storage. The goal is to store as little as possible and have a real lifestyle clearout!

Next month, we have a couple of holidays planned (hopefully we can use these to beta test the map functionality on this site!). When we get back at the start of May, I need to hand in my notice at work, and then we move out of the flat!

Then we'll have a few weeks visiting/staying with family, before flying off hopefully at the end of June (Just the small matter of renewing passports, applying for visas and booking flights to sort out before then)!

So, hopefully all goes to plan this time - we'll keep you updated!
