## Exploring SA

This is a throwback post to October 2019 when I last visited Australia.

I spent 2 weeks away in total, just over a week visiting my brother James and seeing all that Adelaide has to offer, and a few days either side in Sydney. In Adelaide we went on a few day trips including some bush hikes.

I saw some native animals that I hadn't seen before, like Echidnas. And some that I had seen before like Koalas and Kangaroos.
